      <title>Configuring Cisco IOS XE With YANG-based YAML Files</title>

      <guid>https://networkop.co.uk/blog/2017/03/13/yaml-yang/</guid>
      <description>One thing that puts a lot of network engineers off NETCONF and YANG is the complexity of the device configuration process. Even the simplest change involves multiple tools and requires some knowledge of XML. In this post I will show how to use simple, human-readable YAML configuration files to instantiate YANG models and push them down to network devices using a single command</description>

      <description>Now it&amp;rsquo;s time to turn our gaze to the godfather of YANG models and one of the most famous open-source SDN controllers, OpenDaylight.

      <title>Introduction to YANG Programming and RESTCONF on Cisco IOS XE</title>

      <description>The sheer size of some of the YANG models can scare away even the bravest of network engineers. However, as it is with any programming language, the complexity is built out of a finite set of simple concepts. In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll learn some of these concepts by building our own YANG model to program static IP routes on Cisco IOS XE</description>

      <title>Getting Started With NETCONF and YANG on Cisco IOS XE</title>
      <link>https://networkop.co.uk/blog/2017/01/25/netconf-intro/</link>

      <guid>https://networkop.co.uk/blog/2017/01/25/netconf-intro/</guid>
      <description>Everyone who has any interest in network automation inevitably comes across NETCONF and YANG. These technologies have mostly been implemented for and adopted by big telcos and service providers, while support in the enterprise/DC gear has been virtually non-existent. Things are starting to change now as NETCONF/YANG support has been introduced in the latest IOS XE software train. That&amp;rsquo;s why I think it&amp;rsquo;s high time I started another series of posts dedicated to YANG, NETCONF, RESTCONF and various open-source tools to interact with those interfaces</description>

      <title>OpenStack SDN With OVN (Part 2) - Network Engineering Analysis</title>
      <link>https://networkop.co.uk/blog/2016/12/10/ovn-part2/</link>

      <guid>https://networkop.co.uk/blog/2016/12/10/ovn-part2/</guid>
      <description>In this post we will see how OVN implements virtual networks for OpenStack. The structure of this post is such that starting from the highest level of networking abstraction we will delve deeper into implementation details with each subsequent section. The biggest emphasis will be on how networking data model gets transformed into a set of logical flows, which eventually become OpenFlow flows. The final section will introduce a new overlay protocol GENEVE and explain why VXLAN no longer satisfies the needs of an overlay protocol.</description>

      <description>This post gives a quick overview of how to use network Test Driven Development framework. As an example I&amp;rsquo;ll use a simplified version of a typical enterprise network with a Data Centre/HQ and a Branch office. A new branch is being added and the task is to configure routing for that branch using a TDD approach. First we&amp;rsquo;ll devise a set of TDD scenarios to be tested and then, going through each one of them, modify routing to make sure those scenarios don&amp;rsquo;t fail (a so-called red-green-refactor approach)</description>

      <description>In the following series of posts I will show how to build a simple Test-Driven Development framework for Cisco devices. This framework will allow a network engineer to define traffic patterns in a human-readable format and automatically check if those assumption hold. It will be built as a series of Ansible modules and playbooks. The idea is to show an example of how programming can be used by network engineers even now, before all devices acquire their own APIs as well as introduce some well-known programming paradigms and best practices to network engineers thereby making a small step towards networking nirvana a.k.a. SDN. The reader is assumed to have only a basic networking, linux and python programming skills</description>

      <title>Structured Approach to Troubleshooting of L3VPN Networks</title>
      <link>https://networkop.co.uk/blog/2015/06/10/l3vpn-mpls-troubleshoot/</link>

      <guid>https://networkop.co.uk/blog/2015/06/10/l3vpn-mpls-troubleshoot/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the amount of configuration involved in a typical L3VPN configuration, troubleshooting process can get pretty chaotic, especially
in a time-constrained environments like CCIE lab. That&amp;rsquo;s why it is extremely important to have a well-structured approach to quickly
narrow down the potential problem area. I used the below algorithm while preparing for my lab exam.
Like most of the networking problems, troubleshooting of L3VPNs can and must be split into two different phases - control plane and data plane.
All steps must be done sequentially with each next step relying on the successful verification of all previous steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://networkop.co.uk/img/l3vpn.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Test topology&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Problem definition&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;CE-1 (10.0.0.1) can not reach CE-2 (10.0.0.2)&lt;/dd&gt;
