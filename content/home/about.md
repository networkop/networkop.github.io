# Who is this guy?

I'm a network-focused infrastructure architect with expertise stretching from cloud design to software engineering. I've built numerous private clouds for Telcos and Enterprise customers and implemented custom functionality in various software projects. My areas of interest are:

* Private cloud infrastructure networking - everything inside Kubernetes and OpenStack.
* All aspects of infrastructure automation.
* Network software engineering.

If you have a problem that requires a deep understanding of modern networking stack (SDN, CNI, eBPF, Service Mesh) and/or integration of host-based and physical networking, you can reach out to me on LinkedIn or Twitter.
