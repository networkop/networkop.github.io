      <description>Last week I posted a tweet about a Kubernetes networking puzzle. In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll go over the details of this puzzle and uncover the true cause and motive of the misbehaving ingress.
Puzzle recap Imagine you have a Kubernetes cluster with three namespaces, each with its own namespace-scoped ingress controller. You&amp;rsquo;ve created an ingress in each namespace that exposes a simple web application. You&amp;rsquo;ve checked one of them, made sure it works and moved on to other things.</description>

      <title>Structured Approach to Troubleshooting of L3VPN Networks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the amount of configuration involved in a typical L3VPN configuration, troubleshooting process can get pretty chaotic, especially
in a time-constrained environments like CCIE lab. That&amp;rsquo;s why it is extremely important to have a well-structured approach to quickly
narrow down the potential problem area. I used the below algorithm while preparing for my lab exam.
Like most of the networking problems, troubleshooting of L3VPNs can and must be split into two different phases - control plane and data plane.
All steps must be done sequentially with each next step relying on the successful verification of all previous steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Problem definition&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;CE-1 (10.0.0.1) can not reach CE-2 (10.0.0.2)&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;</description>
