I'm a Network Engineer, CCIE #42378, with exposure into many aspects of enterprise network design. I take everyday tasks like network deployments, upgrades or migrations and try to approach them with developer mindset. That's why most of the posts in this blog are about network automation and testing. 
All information and opinions in this blog are my own and do not reflect the views of my current, past of future employers. Please use all provided code at your own peril.
