      <description>In one of his recent posts, Ivan raises a question: &amp;ldquo;I canâ€™t grasp why Cumulus releases a Vagrant box, but not a Docker container&amp;rdquo;. Coincidentally, only a few weeks before that I had managed to create a Cumulus Linux container image. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve done a lot of testing and discovered limitations of the pure containerised approach and how to overcome them while still retaining the container user experience. This post is a documentation of my journey from the early days of running Cumulus on Docker to the integration with containerlab and, finally, running Cumulus in microVMs backed by AWS&amp;rsquo;s Firecracker and Weavework&amp;rsquo;s Ignite.</description>

      <description>Virtual networking has been one of the hottest areas of research and development in recent years. Kubernetes alone has, at the time of writing, 20 different networking plugins, some of which can be combined to build even more plugins. However, if we dig a bit deeper, most of these plugins and solutions are built out of two very simple constructs:
 a virtual switch - anything from a linux bridge through VPP and IOVisor to OVS ACL/NAT - most commonly implemented as iptables, with anything from netfilter to eBPF under the hood   Note1: for the purpose of this article I won&amp;rsquo;t consider service meshes as a network solution, although it clearly is one, simply because it operates higher than TCP/IP and ultimately still requires network plumbing to be in place</description>
