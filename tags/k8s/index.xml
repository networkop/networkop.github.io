      <description>In September 2019 I had the honour to present at Open Networking Summit in Antwerp. My talk was about meshnet CNI plugin, k8s-topo orchestrator and how to use them for large-scale network simulations in Kubernetes. During the same conference, I attended a talk about Network Service Mesh and its new kernel-based forwarding dataplane which had a lot of similarities with the work that I&amp;rsquo;ve done for meshnet. Having had a chat with the presenters, we&amp;rsquo;ve decided that it would be interesting to try and implement a meshnet-like functionality with NSM.</description>
