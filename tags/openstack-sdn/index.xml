      <title>OpenStack SDN With OVN (Part 2) - Network Engineering Analysis</title>
      <link>https://networkop.co.uk/blog/2016/12/10/ovn-part2/</link>

      <description>In this post we will see how OVN implements virtual networks for OpenStack. The structure of this post is such that starting from the highest level of networking abstraction we will delve deeper into implementation details with each subsequent section. The biggest emphasis will be on how networking data model gets transformed into a set of logical flows, which eventually become OpenFlow flows. The final section will introduce a new overlay protocol GENEVE and explain why VXLAN no longer satisfies the needs of an overlay protocol.</description>

      <description>In the previous post I&amp;rsquo;ve demonstrated how to get a working instance of a single-node OpenStack inside UNetLab. In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll continue building on that by adding two new compute nodes and redesigning our network to resemble something you might actually see in a real life.</description>
