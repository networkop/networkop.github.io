      <description>Current network overview Let&amp;rsquo;s start by taking a high-level look at our DC network routing topology. The core routing protocol is OSPF, it is responsible for distributing routing information between the Core and WAN layers of the network. WAN layer consists of two MPLS L3VPN services running BGP as PE-CE protocol and two DMVPN Hubs running EIGRP. All WAN layer devices perform mutual redistribution between the respective WAN protocol and OSPF.</description>

      <description>Demo network overview The network consists of 4 nodes interconnected via point-to-point links and running EIGRP as a routing protocol.
To create a local development environment you can clone my repository and reset it to work with your own Github account using git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/OTHERREPOSITORY.git command.
Local development environment contains the following files describing the modelled topology:

      <description>Packer intro Packer is a tool that can automatically create virtual machines for different hypervisors and cloud platforms. The goal is to produce identically configured VMs for either VirtualBox, VMWare, Amazon or Google clouds based on a single template file. If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with Vagrant, then you can also use Packer to create custom Vagrant boxes. In our case, however, we&amp;rsquo;re only concerned about VMWare since it&amp;rsquo;s the only type-2 hypervisor that supports nested hardware virtualisation (e.</description>

      <description>CI/CD vs ITIL How do you implement changes in your network? In today&amp;rsquo;s world there&amp;rsquo;s 95% chance that you have to write up an RFC, submit it at least a week before the planned implementation date, go through at least one CAB meeting and only then, assuming it got approved, can you implement it. But the most important question is &amp;lsquo;how do you test&amp;rsquo;? Do you simply content yourself with a few pings or do you make sure all main routes are in place?</description>

      <description>Extracting Node&amp;rsquo;s UUID In the previous post we have learned how to create a Node. To perform further actions on it we need to know it&amp;rsquo;s UUID. According to HTTP specification 201 - Created response SHOULD return a Location header with resource URI, which would contain resource UUID. However, UNetLab&amp;rsquo;s implementation does not return a Location header so we need to extract that information ourselves. To do that we&amp;rsquo;ll use the previously defined .</description>

      <description>REST SDK Design As it is with networks, design is a very crucial part of programming. I won&amp;rsquo;t pretend to be an expert in that field and merely present the way I&amp;rsquo;ve built REST SDK. Fortunately, a lot of design will mimic the objects and their relationship on the server side. I&amp;rsquo;ll slightly enhance it to improve code re-use and portability. Here are the basic objects:
 RestServer - implements basic application-agnostic HTTP CRUD logic UnlServer - an extension of a RestServer with specific authentication method (cookie-based) and several additional methods Device - an instance of a network device with specific attributes like type, image name, number of CPUs UnlLab - a lab instance existing inside a UnlServer UnlNode - a node instance existing inside a UnlLab UnlNet - a network instance also existing inside a UnlLab object  All these objects and their relationships are depicted on the following simplified UML diagram.</description>

      <description>UnetLab Installation Since UNL is a separate project with its own evolving documentation I won&amp;rsquo;t try to reproduce it in my blog and I&amp;rsquo;ll simply refer all my readers to UNL download page, UNL installation instructions and UNL first boot configuration.
At the time of writing UNL is distributed as an image packaged in Open Virtualization Format. I&amp;rsquo;m using VMWare Workstation as a type-2 hypervisor to import and run this image.</description>

      <description>Management interface evolution Since the early dawn of networking, devices have been configured through VTYs. The transport has evolved from telnet to ssh but the underlying rule still maintained that network is configured manually, device-by-device by a human administrator. It&amp;rsquo;s obvious that this approach does not scale and is prone to human error, however it still remains the most prevalent method of network device configuration.
The first attempt to tackle these issues has been made in 1988 with the introduction of SNMP.</description>

      <description>In this post I will also introduce two concepts that are frequently used in software development world - DRY and &amp;ldquo;Convention over Configuration&amp;rdquo;. This post is a precursor to the upcoming FlexVPN configuration post on Packetpushers.
FlexVPN network overview FlexVPN topology will consist of two FlexVPN &amp;ldquo;clouds&amp;rdquo;. Each cloud has a Hub router and multiple Spokes. Each Spoke is connected to each of the two Hubs thereby participating in both FlexVPN clouds.</description>

      <description>This is where configuration may get particularly messy especially in presence of backdoor links and complex routing failover policies. However, as I will show, it is still possible to create a standard set of routing manipulation policies and selectively apply them to the required adjacencies to achieve the desired effect.
Requirements and assumptions The new office network is designed with several layers of WAN redundancy. Primary WAN link is the preferred option to reach all other WAN destination except for the Main office which is connected via a dedicated high-throughput link.</description>

      <description>Prerequisites It is assumed that by this time all detailed network design information is known including interfaces numbers, VLANs, IP addresses and LAGs. This information will be used as an input to configuration automation scripts.
The inventory file is updated with a new branch-2 group
[branch-2] BR2-CORE ansible_ssh_host=10.0.3.1 BR2-WAN1 ansible_ssh_host=10.0.3.2 BR2-WAN2 ansible_ssh_host=10.0.3.3 BR2-AS01 ansible_ssh_host=10.0.3.130 BR2-AS02 ansible_ssh_host=10.0.3.131 BR2-AS03 ansible_ssh_host=10.0.3.132  Creating device bootstrap configuration A lot of times when building a new network it is required to create a bootstrap config that would have some basic AAA configuration along with the layer 2 and layer 3 links configuration.</description>

      <description>A lot of configuration files referenced throughout this post will be omitted for the sake of brevity, however all of them can be found in my github repository.
Legacy network overview The network I&amp;rsquo;m using for demonstration is a cut-down version of a typical enterprise network. At this point of time it consists of a branch office network and a central DC network interconnected via redundant WAN links. The branch office consists of a main computer room hosting all core network devices and interconnecting with access switches on each of the office floors.</description>

      <description>Automating Network Configuration Automation and programmability steadily make their way into a networking domain. The idea was born in application development world where makefiles served a role of automated installation scripts. It later spread into application testing and deployment so now hardly anyone does these two things by hand. Next in line were the operating systems largely thanks to the raising popularity of PaaS solutions. Until recently network configuration has been the prerogative of us, network engineers.</description>

      <description>Network overview Let&amp;rsquo;s assume you&amp;rsquo;re working in a proverbial Acme Inc. It has a Data Centre hosting all centralised services and a single office branch (Branch #1). Sites are interconnected using active/backup WAN links. The company decides to expand and adds a new office in a city nearby. In additional to standard dual WAN links it&amp;rsquo;s possible to buy a cheap and high throughput backdoor link between the two branches.</description>

      <description>Now that Ansible has done all the information gathering for us it&amp;rsquo;s time to finally make use of it. In this post I will show how to use Ansible to run traceroutes from and to the hosts defined in a test scenario and perform verification of the results of those tests. Should any of those tests fail, Ansible will provide a meaningful description of what exactly failed and why. While doing all this I&amp;rsquo;ll introduce a couple of new Ansible features like conditional looping and interactive prompts.</description>

      <description>Ansible has a very neat feature called &amp;ldquo;fact gathering&amp;rdquo;, which collects useful information from hosts prior to executing any of the tasks and makes this information available for use within those tasks. Unfortunately, this also relies on Python being available on the remote machine which doesn&amp;rsquo;t work for Cisco IOS. In this post I&amp;rsquo;ll show how to write a simple module which will collect IP address information from remote devices and store it in global variable for future use.</description>

      <description>Ansible is well-known for it&amp;rsquo;s low entry threshold. All what&amp;rsquo;s required to get started is just one inventory file. However Cisco IOS devices require special considerations. Passwordless SSH RSA-based authentication is still a novelty and in most cases users are authenticated based on their passwords. Another problem is the lack of Python execution environment on IOS devices, which seriously limits the choice of Ansible modules that can be used. In this post I will show how to setup Ansible environment to control Cisco IOS devices</description>

      <description>My development environment usually consists of a host machine running Windows and a development Linux &amp;ldquo;headless&amp;rdquo; virtual machine. I create and edit files in a Notepad++ text editor and then transfer them over to the Linux VM. Until recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been using a hypervisor-enabled &amp;ldquo;shared&amp;rdquo; folder. However, Windows file system emulators in Linux do not support symbolic links and therefore breaks a lot of applications that rely on them. This prompted me to start looking for a new way to sync my files.</description>

      <description>Before we proceed with TDD framework build it is important to have the development environment setup. In our case it will consist of two major components:
 Network Simulation Environment Ansible Development Environment  To simplify things I will run both of these environments on the same Virtual Machine. For network simulation I will use UnetLab, a wonderful product developed by Andrea Dainese. Currently, UnetLab is distributed as an OVA package and is available for free download on the website.</description>

      <description>Before we begin (optional section) Before we go on, I&amp;rsquo;d like to put a little disclaimer about terms being used in this post. TDD, and its counterpart BDD, are well-known and accepted practices in development world. Both rely on the assumption that tests will be written before the code and will drive code development. This seemingly unnatural approach became extremely popular with the advent of Agile and is still being widely used, specifically in web development.</description>
