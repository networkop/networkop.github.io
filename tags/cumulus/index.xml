      <description>In one of his recent posts, Ivan raises a question: &amp;ldquo;I canâ€™t grasp why Cumulus releases a Vagrant box, but not a Docker container&amp;rdquo;. Coincidentally, only a few weeks before that I had managed to create a Cumulus Linux container image. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve done a lot of testing and discovered limitations of the pure containerised approach and how to overcome them while still retaining the container user experience. This post is a documentation of my journey from the early days of running Cumulus on Docker to the integration with containerlab and, finally, running Cumulus in microVMs backed by AWS&amp;rsquo;s Firecracker and Weavework&amp;rsquo;s Ignite.</description>
