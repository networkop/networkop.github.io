      <title>iBGP Fall-over Trick</title>

      <description>BGP fall-over is a neat BGP convergence optimisation technique whereby BGP peering is brought down as soon as the route to neighbor disappears from a routing table. The difference between external and internal BGP is that the former usually peers over a directly-attached interface so that when the interface to neighbor is disconnected, route is withdrawn from the routing table which triggers eBGP fall-over to bring down the neighborship. iBGP, on the other hand, normally uses device loopbacks to establish peering sessions.</description>

      <title>Structured Approach to Troubleshooting of L3VPN Networks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the amount of configuration involved in a typical L3VPN configuration, troubleshooting process can get pretty chaotic, especially
in a time-constrained environments like CCIE lab. That&amp;rsquo;s why it is extremely important to have a well-structured approach to quickly
narrow down the potential problem area. I used the below algorithm while preparing for my lab exam.
Like most of the networking problems, troubleshooting of L3VPNs can and must be split into two different phases - control plane and data plane.
All steps must be done sequentially with each next step relying on the successful verification of all previous steps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://networkop.co.uk/img/l3vpn.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Test topology&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;Problem definition&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dd&gt;CE-1 (10.0.0.1) can not reach CE-2 (10.0.0.2)&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;</description>

      <title>Best practices for enterprise IP routing</title>

      <description>What motivated me to write this post is a state of the IP routing of some of the enterprise networks I&amp;rsquo;ve seen. A quick show ip route command reveals a non-disentanglable mixture of dynamic and static route with multiple points of redistribution and complex, rigid filtering rules, something you&amp;rsquo;d only see in your bad dream or a CCIE-level lab. It certainly takes a good engineer to understand how it works and even that can take up to several hours.</description>
